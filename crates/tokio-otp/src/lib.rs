//! The front door to OTP-style fault tolerance on `tokio`: supervised typed
//! actor graphs with one integrated [`Runtime`].
//!
//! For the common setup — every actor of a graph running as its own
//! supervised child — you need one import and one builder:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tokio_otp::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct Echo;
//!
//! impl Actor for Echo {
//!     type Msg = String;
//!
//!     async fn handle(&mut self, message: String, _ctx: &ActorContext<String>) -> ActorResult {
//!         println!("{message}");
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let mut graph = GraphBuilder::new();
//! let echo = graph.add(Echo);
//!
//! let runtime = Runtime::builder()
//!     .graph(graph.build()?)
//!     .strategy(Strategy::OneForOne)
//!     .build()?;
//! let handle = runtime.spawn();
//!
//! echo.send("hello".to_owned()).await?;
//! handle.shutdown_and_wait().await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See [`RuntimeBuilder`] for a complete example. The [`prelude`] re-exports
//! this crate's whole surface plus the common types of `tokio-supervisor`,
//! which remains independently usable for supervision without actors.
//!
//! # Core types
//!
//! | Type | Role |
//! |------|------|
//! | [`Runtime`] / [`RuntimeBuilder`] | Owns a supervisor and actor factory — the common composition. |
//! | [`RuntimeHandle`] | Control surface for a spawned runtime (shutdown, dynamic actors, observability). |
//! | [`SupervisedActors`] | Adapts a graph into per-actor supervised children with configurable policies. |
//! | [`GraphBuilder`] / [`Graph`] | Constructs and validates the actor graph; wiring plus runnable actors. |
//! | [`Actor`] | Handler-style actor definition with a provided receive loop. |
//! | [`RawActor`] | Custom-loop typed actor definition (the escape hatch). |
//! | [`ActorRef`] | Cloneable, restart-stable, typed mailbox sender. |
//! | [`ActorContext`] | Mailbox, monitors, timers, blocking work, and shutdown token visible to one actor. |
//! | [`MailboxMode`] | FIFO or latest-wins storage policy selected per actor. |
//! | [`Reply`] | One-shot response channel carried inside request messages. |
//! | [`RunnableActor`] | One actor plus stable binding — the unit of execution. |
//!
//! # Composition modes
//!
//! - **The integrated runtime** via [`Runtime::builder`]: per-actor
//!   supervision with uniform policies and runtime actor creation. Omit
//!   [`RuntimeBuilder::graph`] to start with no actors.
//!
//! - **Per-actor supervision** via [`SupervisedActors`]: each actor becomes its
//!   own child in a supervisor, with individual restart and shutdown policies.
//!   Use [`build_runtime`](SupervisedActors::build_runtime) for the integrated
//!   [`Runtime`] or [`build`](SupervisedActors::build) for raw child specs.
//!
//! Fate-sharing is selected with [`Strategy::OneForAll`](tokio_supervisor::Strategy::OneForAll)
//! or supervision-tree shape; graphs themselves are not execution units.
//!
//! # Delivery contract: at-most-once
//!
//! Mailboxes are incarnation-owned: each actor run binds a fresh mailbox, and
//! messages accepted by a dead incarnation are lost with it. Delivery is
//! therefore **at-most-once**, with loss windows at restart and shutdown.
//! Stronger guarantees (acknowledgements, redelivery) are user protocol built
//! on [`ActorRef::call`] and [`Reply`], not transport features.
//!
//! [`ActorContext::recv`] is fail-fast during shutdown: it returns `None` as
//! soon as shutdown is requested, even when messages are still queued. Actors
//! that must finish queued work before stopping implement [`Actor`] with
//! [`DrainPolicy::Drain`], or drain by hand with [`ActorContext::try_recv`].
//!
//! Restarts also lose queued messages: a restarted actor binds a fresh
//! mailbox, so messages queued behind a poison message are dropped with the
//! old one. This is deliberate — a mailbox that survived restarts would
//! redeliver the poison message that caused the crash, converting one
//! failure into a restart loop. [`ActorRef::send`] rides through restart
//! windows when a rebind is expected, and restart resets actor state to the
//! wiring-time value (`Clone` is the reset mechanism; see [`Actor`]).
//!
//! Actors can observe a peer incarnation with [`ActorContext::monitor`]. Its
//! [`Down`] notification is mapped into the observer's message type and
//! delivered through the ordinary mailbox. [`MonitorRef::cancel`] suppresses
//! future delivery, and all monitors are cancelled automatically when the
//! observing actor stops or restarts.
//!
//! # Static topologies
//!
//! For cyclic actor graphs, derive [`Topology`] on a named-field struct whose
//! fields are the actors. The wiring closure receives typed refs for every
//! field before any actor is constructed; see the [`Topology`] docs for the
//! full contract, and mind the bounded-mailbox cycle hazard documented on
//! [`GraphBuilder`].
//!
//! # Hand-driving actors
//!
//! Supervision through [`Runtime`] is the normal host, but the execution
//! surface is public: each [`RunnableActor`] can be driven directly with
//! [`run_until`](RunnableActor::run_until), which is how tests (and hosts
//! with their own supervision story) run actors.
//!
//! ```
//! use tokio_otp::{
//!     Actor, ActorContext, ActorResult, CancellationToken, GraphBuilder, RebindPolicy, Reply,
//! };
//!
//! enum CounterMsg {
//!     Add(u64),
//!     Total(Reply<u64>),
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct Counter {
//!     total: u64,
//! }
//!
//! impl Actor for Counter {
//!     type Msg = CounterMsg;
//!
//!     async fn handle(
//!         &mut self,
//!         message: CounterMsg,
//!         _ctx: &ActorContext<CounterMsg>,
//!     ) -> ActorResult {
//!         match message {
//!             CounterMsg::Add(n) => self.total += n,
//!             CounterMsg::Total(reply) => reply.send(self.total),
//!         }
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let mut builder = GraphBuilder::new();
//! builder.name("example");
//! let counter = builder.add(Counter { total: 0 });
//! let graph = builder.build().expect("valid graph");
//!
//! let actor = graph.actors()[0].clone();
//! let stop = CancellationToken::new();
//! let run = tokio::spawn({
//!     let stop = stop.clone();
//!     async move { actor.run_until(stop.cancelled(), RebindPolicy::Never).await }
//! });
//!
//! counter.send(CounterMsg::Add(2)).await.expect("send succeeded");
//! counter.send(CounterMsg::Add(3)).await.expect("send succeeded");
//! assert_eq!(counter.call(CounterMsg::Total).await?, 5);
//!
//! stop.cancel();
//! run.await??;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Observability
//!
//! `tracing` spans and structured logs are emitted automatically for
//! supervisor, actor, and mailbox lifecycle. Pull-based message counters and
//! live mailbox usage are available through [`ActorRef::stats`] and
//! [`RuntimeHandle::actor_stats`]; exporting time-series is a user-side
//! sampler task over those surfaces (see `examples/actor_metrics.rs`).
//! Actors registered with [`ActorOptions::message_size`] expose
//! application-defined accepted-byte totals through [`ActorStats`] and emit
//! size metrics when the `metrics` feature is enabled. The same options can
//! select a [`MailboxMode`] and apply to statically or dynamically registered
//! actors.
//! Install subscribers and samplers at the application boundary, not inside
//! the library.
//!
//! # Deliberate dependency coupling
//!
//! Public mailbox errors are crate-owned, so changing the underlying channel
//! implementation does not change the actor API. Cancellation is deliberately
//! different: [`CancellationToken`] is the shared shutdown vocabulary at the
//! Tokio ecosystem boundary. [`ActorContext::shutdown_token`],
//! [`ActorContext::run_blocking`], and the shutdown futures passed to
//! [`RunnableActor::run_until`] compose directly with that exact
//! `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` type. Applications can therefore
//! connect actor shutdown to existing cancellation trees without adapters. The
//! token is re-exported here (and in [`prelude`]) so common local
//! examples and small applications do not need an additional import path.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - `examples/supervised_actors.rs` — per-actor supervision with default
//!   policies.
//! - `examples/topology.rs` — a cyclic graph wired with `#[derive(Topology)]`.
//! - `examples/drain_policy.rs` — draining queued actor messages during
//!   shutdown.
//! - `examples/individual_actor_policies.rs` — per-actor restart/shutdown
//!   overrides.
//! - `examples/dynamic_actors.rs` — adding and removing actors at runtime.
//! - `examples/directory.rs` — a typed, userland name directory actor.
//! - `examples/ref_rebind.rs` — refs riding through supervised restarts.
//! - `examples/graph_failures.rs` — supervisor policy around actor failures.
//! - `examples/mailbox_backpressure.rs`, `examples/send_vs_try_send.rs` —
//!   bounded mailboxes and send flavors.
//! - `examples/builder_validation.rs` — build-time graph validation errors.
//! - `examples/blocking_work.rs`, `examples/blocking_lifecycle.rs` —
//!   cooperative and detached blocking work.
//! - `examples/actor_metrics.rs` — the stats-sampler export pattern.
//! - `examples/actor_tracing.rs`, `examples/supervisor_snapshot_trace.rs` —
//!   tracing and snapshot observability.
//! - `examples/json_edge.rs` — decoding byte-oriented JSON frames into typed
//!   actor messages (requires `serde`).
//! - `examples/console.rs` — serving the web console for a supervised
//!   runtime.
