# Watching actors

An actor can watch another actor when a request or piece of state depends on
that peer. A watch follows the *logical* actor — the same restart-stable
identity an `ActorRef` points at — and turns each lifecycle transition into an
ordinary typed message in the observer's mailbox:

```rust
use tokio_otp::{Actor, ActorContext, ActorRef, ActorResult, MonitorEvent};

enum CoordinatorMsg {
    Worker(MonitorEvent),
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Coordinator {
    worker: ActorRef<String>,
}

impl Actor for Coordinator {
    type Msg = CoordinatorMsg;

    async fn on_start(&mut self, ctx: &ActorContext<Self::Msg>) -> ActorResult {
        ctx.watch(&self.worker, CoordinatorMsg::Worker);
        Ok(())
    }

    async fn handle(
        &mut self,
        message: Self::Msg,
        _ctx: &ActorContext<Self::Msg>,
    ) -> ActorResult {
        let CoordinatorMsg::Worker(event) = message;
        match event {
            MonitorEvent::Up { actor_id, generation } => {
                eprintln!("{actor_id} generation {generation} is up");
            }
            MonitorEvent::Down(down) => {
                eprintln!(
                    "{} generation {} exited: {:?}",
                    down.actor_id, down.generation, down.reason
                );
            }
            MonitorEvent::Lagged { actor_id, dropped } => {
                eprintln!("{actor_id} watch lagged, {dropped} transitions dropped");
            }
            MonitorEvent::Terminated { actor_id, .. } => {
                eprintln!("{actor_id} is permanently gone");
            }
            _ => {}
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

A watch belongs to the observing and watched actor memberships. It survives
restarts on both sides, so it never needs to be re-registered while both
memberships live. Events that arrive while the observer is between
incarnations wait for its next mailbox binding. Events arrive in lifecycle
order:

- `MonitorEvent::Up` — an incarnation started. The first actor run is
  generation `0`, and each restart increments the generation. Registering a
  watch on an already-running target delivers an immediate `Up` for the
  current incarnation, so the observer always learns the current state.
- `MonitorEvent::Down` — the current incarnation exited. `DownReason::Normal`
  covers a clean return and cooperative shutdown; `DownReason::Failure` covers
  errors, panics, aborts, and a dropped actor run. If the supervisor restarts
  the actor, a matching `Up` follows.
- `MonitorEvent::Lagged` — one or more transitions were dropped because the
  observer could not keep up under sustained overload. This is a
  resynchronization point, not an edge: treat the events that follow it as the
  target's current state rather than assuming strict `Up`/`Down` alternation. A
  healthy observer never sees it.
- `MonitorEvent::Terminated` — the actor is permanently gone (its binding was
  terminated, or it was dropped without ever starting). No further events
  will be delivered.

A watch registered before the target's first start stays silent until
generation `0` starts, and a watch registered between incarnations stays
silent until the next `Up`. This removes actor-start and restart ordering
races from a graph: there is never a reason to retry registration.

`ActorContext::watch` returns a cloneable `MonitorRef`. Calling `cancel` on
any clone suppresses future delivery. Cancellation cannot retract an event
already accepted by the mailbox. Permanently removing either actor membership
also ends the watch; a watched actor's final `Terminated` event is queued
before its membership removal completes.

Calling `watch` again for the same observer/subject pair is idempotent. This
keeps the common pattern of registering in `on_start` safe when the observer
restarts: the replacement incarnation gets the existing watch rather than a
duplicate immediate `Up`. The mapping closure from the first registration is
membership-owned and remains in use until cancellation, so it should capture
durable configuration rather than incarnation-local state.

Watch notifications use the observer's ordinary mailbox. FIFO mailboxes wait
for capacity and preserve every accepted notification. A conflating mailbox
may replace an unread event with a later one, so use FIFO when every
transition must be observed.

Undelivered events are held in a bounded per-watch buffer. Under normal load
this is never a factor — lifecycle events are rare. But if an observer's
mailbox stays full while its target restarts in a tight loop, the buffer caps
the memory that can accumulate: the oldest staged events are dropped. The loss
is never silent — the dropped span is folded into a single `Lagged` marker, so
the observer learns it fell behind and can resynchronize to the current state
rather than replaying the entire storm. Because no mailbox mode can guarantee
that every transition is observed under sustained overload, consumers that
react to individual transitions should treat `Lagged` as a resync point. The
terminal `Terminated` event is always the newest event, so it is never
dropped.

For one-shot, incarnation-scoped monitoring — "tell me if the incarnation I
am talking to right now dies" — watch the target, act on the first `Down`,
and cancel the `MonitorRef`.
