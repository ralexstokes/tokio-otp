# Supervision fundamentals

Time to open the print shop. In this chapter we stay in `tokio-supervisor`
land and supervise two plain tasks: a `front-desk` that should run forever,
and a `press` that keeps jamming. Along the way we meet every knob a
[`ChildSpec`] has.

```rust,no_run
use std::time::Duration;

use tokio_supervisor::{
    BackoffPolicy, ChildSpec, Restart, RestartIntensity, ShutdownPolicy, Strategy,
    SupervisorBuilder,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // A press that jams shortly after starting.
    let press = ChildSpec::new("press", |ctx| async move {
        println!("press starting (generation {})", ctx.generation);
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
        Err("paper jam".into())
    })
    .restart(Restart::Transient)
    .restart_intensity(
        RestartIntensity::new(3, Duration::from_secs(10))
            .with_backoff(BackoffPolicy::Fixed(Duration::from_millis(100))),
    )
    .shutdown(ShutdownPolicy::cooperative_then_abort(Duration::from_secs(1)));

    // A front desk that runs until asked to stop.
    let front_desk = ChildSpec::new("front-desk", |ctx| async move {
        ctx.token.cancelled().await;
        Ok(())
    })
    .restart(Restart::Permanent);

    let supervisor = SupervisorBuilder::new()
        .strategy(Strategy::OneForOne)
        .child(press)
        .child(front_desk)
        .build()?;

    let handle = supervisor.spawn();
    match handle.wait().await {
        Ok(exit) => println!("supervisor exited cleanly: {exit:?}"),
        Err(error) => println!("supervisor gave up: {error}"),
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Running this prints the press restarting three times, each generation 100 ms
apart, and then the supervisor giving up because the restart intensity limit
was exceeded:

```text
press starting (generation 0)
press starting (generation 1)
press starting (generation 2)
press starting (generation 3)
supervisor gave up: restart intensity exceeded
```

Let's unpack the policies that produced that behaviour.

## Restart policies

Each child has a [`Restart`] policy that decides whether an exit triggers a
restart:

- **`Restart::Permanent`** — always restart, even after a clean `Ok(())`
  exit. Right for services that should simply never stop, like the front
  desk.
- **`Restart::Transient`** (the default) — restart only on failure (`Err`,
  panic, or abort). A clean exit is final. Right for the press: a jam should
  be retried, but if the press decides it is done, it is done.
- **`Restart::Temporary`** — never restart. Runs at most once; useful for
  one-shot startup jobs.

## Restart intensity and backoff

Unbounded restarting would turn a persistent fault into a busy loop, so
restarts are budgeted by a [`RestartIntensity`]: at most `max_restarts`
restarts within a sliding `within` window (the default is 5 restarts within
30 seconds). Exceeding the budget makes the whole supervisor exit with
`SupervisorError::RestartIntensityExceeded` — in a supervision tree, that
escalates the failure to the parent.

A [`BackoffPolicy`] optionally delays each restart attempt: `Fixed`,
`Exponential`, or `ExponentialWithJitter`. A shutdown request always wins over
a pending restart delay.

Intensity can be set on the supervisor as a whole
(`SupervisorBuilder::restart_intensity`) or overridden per child, as we did
for the press.

## Strategies

The [`Strategy`] decides who is affected when a child fails:

- **`Strategy::OneForOne`** (default) — only the failed child restarts. The
  front desk never notices the press jamming.
- **`Strategy::OneForAll`** — every child is stopped and restarted together.
  Use this when children hold interdependent state, e.g. a producer/consumer
  pair that must resynchronize from scratch. (`Temporary` children are drained
  with the group but not respawned.)

## Shutdown policies

When a child must stop — on supervisor shutdown, removal, or a `OneForAll`
group restart — its [`ShutdownPolicy`] governs how:

- **`ShutdownPolicy::cooperative(grace)`** — cancel the child's token and
  wait up to `grace` for a voluntary exit; report a timeout otherwise.
- **`ShutdownPolicy::cooperative_then_abort(grace)`** (default, 5 s grace) —
  same, but fall back to a Tokio `abort()` if the grace period expires.
- **`ShutdownPolicy::abort()`** — abort immediately.

One caveat inherited from Tokio itself: aborts take effect at `.await` points.
A child stuck in a non-yielding loop cannot be preempted — isolate truly
blocking work behind a blocking pool (as `tokio-actor` does, see the next
chapter) or an external process.

## Supervision trees

A supervisor can itself be a child. [`Supervisor::into_child_spec`] converts a
built supervisor into a `ChildSpec`, giving each subsystem its own restart
budget while failures that exhaust it escalate to the parent:

```rust,ignore
let pressroom = SupervisorBuilder::new()
    .child(press) // ... the flaky press from above
    .build()?;

let shop = SupervisorBuilder::new()
    .child(pressroom.into_child_spec("pressroom"))
    .child(front_desk)
    .build()?;
```

The nested supervisor forwards its lifecycle events to the parent and shows up
inside the parent's snapshots, so observability (chapter 6) sees the whole
tree.

## Dynamic children

Children can also be added and removed while the supervisor is running,
through the handle:

```rust,ignore
handle.add_child(ChildSpec::new("night-shift-press", factory)).await?;
handle.remove_child("night-shift-press").await?;

// Target a nested supervisor by path:
handle.add_child_at(["pressroom"], child).await?;
```

A supervisor always keeps at least one child; removing the last one is
refused. We will use a higher-level version of this API in the [Dynamic
actors](dynamic-actors.md) chapter.
