# Dynamic Actors

A runtime does not need a graph at all: `Runtime::builder().build()` starts
empty and idles until `RuntimeHandle::add_actor` adds a typed actor. Each
added actor becomes a supervised child whose id is the actor's label, and
`add_actor` returns the typed `ActorRef<M>` directly — there is no registry
and no string lookup. Refs travel the way any other value does: cloned into an
incarnation by its `ActorFactory`, or delivered by message. Closures and
zero-argument constructor paths implement `ActorFactory` automatically; named
spec structs are useful when durable configuration deserves its own type.

```rust,no_run
use tokio_otp::prelude::Continue;
use tokio_otp::{Actor, ActorContext, ActorRef, ActorResult, DynamicActorOptions, Runtime};
use tokio_supervisor::Strategy;

struct FrontDesk {
    rush: Option<ActorRef<String>>,
}

enum FrontDeskMsg {
    SetRushPress(ActorRef<String>),
    Order(String),
}

impl Actor for FrontDesk {
    type Msg = FrontDeskMsg;

    async fn handle(
        &mut self,
        message: FrontDeskMsg,
        _ctx: &ActorContext<FrontDeskMsg>,
    ) -> ActorResult {
        match message {
            FrontDeskMsg::SetRushPress(rush) => self.rush = Some(rush),
            FrontDeskMsg::Order(order) => {
                self.rush
                    .as_ref()
                    .expect("rush press ref delivered before orders")
                    .send(order)
                    .await?;
            }
        }
        Ok(Continue)
    }
}

struct RushPress;

impl Actor for RushPress {
    type Msg = String;

    async fn handle(&mut self, order: String, _ctx: &ActorContext<String>) -> ActorResult {
        println!("RUSH printed {order}");
        Ok(Continue)
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let runtime = Runtime::builder().strategy(Strategy::OneForOne).build()?;
    let handle = runtime.spawn();

    let orders = handle
        .add_actor("front-desk", || FrontDesk { rush: None }, DynamicActorOptions::default())
        .await?;
    let rush = handle
        .add_actor("rush-press", || RushPress, DynamicActorOptions::default())
        .await?;

    // Distribute the ref by message — the mailbox is the discovery channel.
    orders.send(FrontDeskMsg::SetRushPress(rush.clone())).await?;
    orders.send(FrontDeskMsg::Order("wedding invites x50".into())).await?;
    rush.send("vip banners x2".into()).await?;

    handle.remove_child("front-desk").await?;
    handle.remove_child("rush-press").await?;
    handle.shutdown_and_wait().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`DynamicActorOptions` carries the new child's restart policy, shutdown policy,
optional restart intensity, and terminal-removal behavior. A
`RestartPolicy::Never` actor is removed automatically after either a clean or
failed exit, matching OTP temporary-child semantics; other restart policies
retain a terminal child in the supervisor snapshot by default. Override either
default with `remove_on_exit(bool)`. Removal only follows an exit the policy
will not restart, so it never interrupts a restart cycle. Watches still receive
`Down` followed by `Terminated` before the membership disappears. Consequently,
`Terminated` alone does not mean the child id is reusable: wait for removal to
complete or use a fresh id rather than immediately re-adding the same one.

With a group strategy, opting a non-`Never` actor into removal makes timing
observable. If its non-restarted exit is handled before a later group restart,
removal is permanent and that restart cannot revive it. If the actor exits while
an already-active group restart is draining it, the exit belongs to that restart
cycle and the actor is respawned.

These defaults apply only to actors added with `add_actor`. Actors declared in
the static graph remain registered after terminal exit, even when
`SupervisedActors::actor_restart` gives them `RestartPolicy::Never`; static
membership can be recreated from the graph when its supervisor restarts.

`add_actor` returns an actor ref matching the factory's actor message type, and
the same ref keeps working across restarts of that actor. Its stability ends at
the membership boundary: remove an actor and that ref becomes terminal. Adding
another actor with the same id returns a fresh ref; the old one never silently
rebinds to the new occupant.

Removal is sequenced supervisor child removal. `remove_child(label)` marks the
membership `Removing` and starts its configured shutdown. When cooperative
shutdown completes within its grace period, an `Actor` stops its normal receive
loop and applies its `DrainPolicy`: `Drain` closes intake and handles the queued
prefix, while `Discard` drops queued messages without closing intake. It then
runs `on_stop`, terminates the mailbox binding, and detaches the child. Immediate
abort, or expiry of the cooperative grace period, can skip any remaining drain
or hook work before detachment. The removal future completes after detachment.

There is an intentional race boundary: a send can be accepted after removal is
requested but before the actor observes cancellation. `Drain` then closes
intake and handles that accepted prefix. `Discard` does not close intake, so it
can continue accepting messages through `on_stop`; those messages are dropped
when the incarnation ends. During `Drain`'s closed-mailbox window, `try_send`
can report `MailboxClosed`; an awaited `send` waits for the final disposition
and then reports `ActorTerminated`. There is no separate `Draining` error. An
application that must not lose accepted work during a membership change needs
an ownership protocol, described in
[Ownership during membership transitions](ownership-transitions.md).

A runtime can be reduced back to zero actors and keeps running until
`shutdown()` is requested.

## Adding to a nested supervisor

`RuntimeHandle::add_actor` targets the handle's own supervisor. For subtrees
configured with `RuntimeBuilder::subtree`, obtain the actor-aware nested handle
and add the actor normally:

```rust,ignore
let venue = handle.subtree("coinbase").expect("venue is running");
let subscription = venue
    .add_actor(
        "btc-usd",
        Subscription::new,
        DynamicActorOptions::default(),
    )
    .await?;
```

The actor's label (`"btc-usd"` above) is its child id within the nested
supervisor, so remove it through the same handle with
`venue.remove_child("btc-usd")`. Actors added this way are supervised, restart
normally, and appear in both `venue.actor_stats()` and the parent handle's
recursive `actor_stats()` result.

If an id is removed and later reused, compare the snapshot's
`membership_epoch` (also present in runtime-scoped `ActorStats`) as well as its
`generation`: restarts keep an epoch and increment the generation, while a new
membership receives a later epoch and starts again at generation zero. For
recursive stats, also compare `ActorStats::supervisor_path`; it distinguishes
otherwise identical local ids and epochs in sibling or restarted subtrees.

For a raw nested `Supervisor` that was not built as a runtime subtree, use
`Graph::dynamic_factory`, `RuntimeHandle::supervisor`, and
`SupervisorHandleExt` as the lower-level escape hatch. Actors added through
that raw path are not part of runtime actor stats. Raw removals also bypass the
runtime registry's immediate bookkeeping; the next `actor_stats()` sample
reconciles tracked entries against the supervisor snapshot and prunes removed
children.

## Name-based discovery, when you want it

When an application genuinely wants name-based discovery — plugins looking
each other up at runtime, say — build it as an ordinary actor. A typed
directory is about twenty lines:

```rust,ignore
enum DirectoryMsg<M> {
    Insert(String, ActorRef<M>),
    Get(String, Reply<Option<ActorRef<M>>>),
}

struct Directory<M> {
    entries: HashMap<String, ActorRef<M>>,
}
```

Insert refs as actors are created, and `call` the directory to resolve a name
to a typed ref. Because the directory is self-hosted, *you* choose its
semantics — namespacing, removal, versioning — instead of inheriting a
framework registry's. The runnable version is
`crates/tokio-otp/examples/directory.rs`.

Note that a directory instance is homogeneous: `Directory<M>` holds refs to
actors whose message type is that one `M`, and that is what makes lookups
fully typed with no downcasting. If several message types need discovery, run
one small directory per type. A single heterogeneous registry is possible by
storing `Box<dyn Any>` and downcasting on `Get`, but that reintroduces the
runtime type checks a stringly-typed framework registry would have imposed —
which is exactly the cost this design avoids.
